    ○ Expected response format (success/failure message, campaign ID)
  ● Briefly explain how you would handle data validation and error handling on the backend.

  Task 2: Frontend User Interface (Code Sample):
  Develop a basic user interface (UI) prototype using your preferred frontend framework (e.g.,
  React, Vue.js) that allows users to create a new email campaign. The UI should include
